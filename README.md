# kickstarter-analysis

Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. By discovering trends, we are hoping to help Louise make the best informed decision possible in order to gain necessary funding for her play.

Analysis and Challenges: 
Using tools on Excel, I drew the important pieces of information and discovered trends. Since Louise is only concerned with the categories theater and plays for her project, I focused only on entries in those categories. Concentrating on only key parts instead of trying to decipher the large amount of data made the analysis easier to determine.
Challenges I encountered were making sure I drew on the correct pieces of information to graph the trends. If I were to draw unnecessary information, the trends may not have been as obvious.

Results: 
One conclusion I can draw from this graph is there were the most successful kickstarters between May and June. This could imply that this time period is the best if you want to start a new production. Another conclusion is the least amount of kickstarters were successful in December. This could be because of the holidays. It would make sense for people to spend their money on festivities than donating to productions.

On the graph of "Outcomes Based On Goals", we can conclude that the highest percentage of failed kickstarters tend to have a lower goal. This could be due to lack of effective organization or any reason people decide not to fund these starters.

Limitations of this dataset include how many backers funded the majority of needed goal and basic information of backers. If this was provided, it would give Louise some idea of what kind of potential backers to target. Also, if genres were provided, we could determine which genres are the most popular to bakcers.

Other tables and graphs include just graphing the kickstarters in the last 2-3 years to determine how is funding like to help figure out the immediate next steps. Also, if we could create a table focusing on the kickstarters with the most backing, we can determine their similarities those could be the key reasons why they are the most favored.
